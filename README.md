A (JSON) data model for displaying dates and date ranges on a calendar interface.

### Usage

```js
var Calendar = require("../index");
var data = new Calendar();

// with custom today date
var  = new Calendar({ today: new Date(1971, 0, 1) });
```

### Get an array of weeks in this month

```js
console.log("Weeks this month:", data.weeks.length);
```

You can use the returned array of arrays to render a full calendar for a given month. If, for example, the month is September of 2018:

```js
data.weeks.map(w => w.map(d => d.day));
```

Will output all the elements as the day number:

```js
[
  [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 1],
  [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
  [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22],
  [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29],
  [30, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
];
```

### Get an array of month names

```js
console.log("Month names", data.monthNames);
```
